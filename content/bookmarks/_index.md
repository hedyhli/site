This page is generated with a script that fetches bookmarks from
[Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) using the API. I also have a Gemini version
(for smolnet links) linked at the footer.

Only the most recent 50 bookmarks are listed. Check out the full list
[here](https://raindrop.io/hedy/bookmarks-50803386).
