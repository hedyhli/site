Thanks for stopping by my digital garden. Here you can write a few words of
feedback or anything else you like and drop the message here for others to see.

Guestbooks are logs of visitors like you, leaving a mark on someone else's
public space. It's an idea from the older days of the internet borrowing from a
decades-old practice that is still alive today in museums, and similar public
facilities.

Sign the guestbook to let me know you were here, any additional thoughts, and
optionally, where you came from as well as a book recommendation. I always love
adding more good books to my "to-read" list.

It's fun, and it adds a personal flair to today's internet run by tech giants
and ad-ridden web spaces.

Consider [creating your own website](https://32bit.cafe/cyowebsite/), [writing
about it](/posts/meta-pages/), and maybe include a guestbook like this one too.
