<h1> Hi, I'm {{% pfp-name %}}<span class="blink">▂</span></h1>

I enjoying tinkering with FLOSS, reading manuals and articles, and hanging
around my `$HOME`.

Follow the rabbit hole sobre mí... [@hedy@tilde.zone](https://tilde.zone/@hedy)

## Contacts

Preferably <a rel="me" href="mailto:hedy@tilde.cafe">email</a> ([PGP](./key.asc)) or
<a rel="me" href="https://tilde.zone/@hedy">Mastodon</a> on the Fediverse.

My interests range from dev tooling, math, cryptology to physics, linguistics
and graphic design. I try to post at least once a year, but sometimes life
happens.

You can also chat with me on IRC, XMPP, or matrix — details on my [about
page](./about/).

## Other details

* I also enjoy tweaking my [configuration and setup](https://github.com/hedyhli/dotfiles) (and believe that it is definitely worth spending **30 minutes** writing a [script](https://hedy.tilde.cafe/how-to-be-productive.jpg) that runs once, for **three milliseconds** \\s).

* Posting shorter, more frequent updates on my journal: [hedy.flounder.online/journal/](https://hedy.flounder.online/journal/).

* Recently, I've made a hand-picked list of cool things on tilde.cafe! Check it out: [~Cafe Spotlight](https://hedy.tilde.cafe/cafe-spotlight/)

* Alternate versions of the content here are available on [gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space) and [spartan://](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/spartan.mozz.us) via the same hostname.
