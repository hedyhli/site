<h1> Hi, I'm {{% pfp-name %}}<span class="blink">â–‚</span></h1>

I build **FLOSS** (Free, Libre Open Source Software) in my spare time, and I'm
quite fond of both minimalist **Text User Interface** gems as well as **graphic design** â€”
practically opposite sides of the spectrum, huh? ðŸ˜„

I enjoy tweaking my [configuration and
setup](https://github.com/hedyhli/dotfiles) and believe that **it is definitely
worth spending 30 minutes writing a
[script](https://hedy.tilde.cafe/how-to-be-productive.jpg) that only gets used
once, for three seconds**.

This website is where I echo long-form thoughts on my [blog](./posts/)
generally once or twice every few months.

I also have a journal where I post shorter, more frequent updates, you can find
it here:
[hedy.flounder.online/journal/](https://hedy.flounder.online/journal/).

Recently, I've made a hand-picked list of cool things on tilde.cafe! Check it out:
[~Cafe Spotlight](https://hedy.tilde.cafe/cafe-spotlight/)

The source code that powers this site is open source, available on SourceHut
with mirrors on Gitea and GitHub: [sr.ht/~hedy/site](https://sr.ht/~hedy/site).

Alternate versions of the content here are available on
[gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space) and
[spartan://](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/spartan.mozz.us) via the same
hostname.

## External links

* [This site on gemini](gemini://hedy.tilde.cafe/): Roughly the same content -- about, gemlog, etc. it also has some CGI scripts
* [My software projects](https://sr.ht/~hedy/): Not a lot since I still have some not-much-maintained ones on GitHub
* [My mastodon profile](https://tilde.zone/@hedy): Don't expect me to be super-duper active, but if you have something to say and DM, I see it almost within the same day.
