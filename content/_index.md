# ~hedy

Hey, you've made it to my website! Please look around and enjoy your time here :D

This is my personal website. It's also on gemini:// via the same hostname. This website
contains my [blog](./posts/) and [about page](./about/).

Keep in mind that many portions of this site is still work in progress, including the CSS.
I post to my blog here from time to time, generally once or twice every few months. I also
have a journal where I post shorter, more frequent updates, you can find it here:
[hedy.flounder.online/journal/](https://hedy.flounder.online/journal/). I might host that
here one day as well.

The website source code is FOSS, available here: [sr.ht/~hedy/site](https://sr.ht/~hedy/site).

## Contacts

Preferably [email](mailto:hedy@tilde.cafe) ([PGP](./key.asc)) or
<a rel="me" href="https://tilde.zone/@hedy">mastodon</a>.
Feel free to post comments to any of my posts to
[my public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~hedy/inbox), note that you'll have to
[use plain text](https://useplaintext.email). You can also chat with me on IRC,
XMPP, or matrix.

Go to my about page for more info.

## External links

* [This site on gemini](gemini://hedy.tilde.cafe/): Roughly the same content -- about, gemlog, etc. it also has some CGI scripts
* [My software projects](https://sr.ht/~hedy/): Not a lot since I still have some not-much-maintained ones on GitHub
* [My mastodon profile](https://tilde.zone/@hedy): Don't expect me to be super-duper active, but if you have something to say and DM, I see it almost within the same day.
