Following up on my [recent post about colophons ("meta" pages)](https://home.hedy.dev/posts/meta-pages/), I've decided to create a webring to gather more personal websites through opt-ins.

I chewed over the initial idea for the former blog post (what, really, was I advocating for?) and wrote a bit more about it in detail in the webring home page -- [meta-ring.hedy.dev](https://meta-ring.hedy.dev/). Here are a few snippets.

> Your personal home page is unique. It is the result of careful craft and deliberation and it represents a piece of you. You make intentional design choices to reflect the values you believe in and how you see yourself, how you wish to be perceived. You choose to use certain technologies that gets you excited, or makes you productive, or simply ones that just "works" for your use-case. You have built workflows and systems for and around producing content on your personal pages, systems that works just for your own little corner of the internet; and you write about all of this in a dedicated page on your very own website and share it with others like you, who are also fascinated by the cool and quirky personal web.

> What should it be about?
> 
> This could be anything you want to write about which you see fit -- what do you care a lot about on your personal site? Is it accessibility? Is it the fonts, the color scheme, or other aspects of design? Is it your blogging scripts, or did you hack together your own static-site generator to build your site from your own custom content format?

> This webring focuses on personal websites. This means organization and project home pages will not be accepted.
> 
> It's great to know about the technology behind your project sites, but the purpose of this webring is to encourage unique personal sites, the joy of exploration and tinkering with technology, reflecting it in your personal site, and sharing it with the world.

A webring is only of as much significance as its members, and this one has only just started -- if you think this is something you'd like to advocate for, I'd love to see what you've made. [Join](https://meta-ring.hedy.dev/#how-do-i-join%3F) the webring by submitting a GitHub PR, or if you prefer, [patches to this mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~hedy/inbox) for [this SourceHut repo](https://sr.ht/~hedy/meta-ring) also works.
