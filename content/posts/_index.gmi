These are my long-form musings. Expect new posts no more frequently than yearly. If you're subscribed to my feed, rest assured it will never update more often than once every two days.

Comments can be sent to my public mailing list where I'll also send new posts as plain text. If you subscribe to the list, it acts like a newsletter where you'll receive new posts from your inbox, and you can reply to the email to start a public discussion.

Subscribing and commenting happen solely through emails. No external auth required.
