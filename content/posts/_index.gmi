These are my long-form musings. I aim to write at least twice a year, but over the past two years I have clearly failed in this aspect. I'll try to write more often.

Comments can be sent to my public mailing list where I'll also send new posts as plain text. If you subscribe to the list, it acts like a newsletter where you'll receive new posts from your inbox, and you can reply to the email to start a public discussion.

Subscribing and commenting happen solely through emails. No external auth required.
