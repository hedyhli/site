These are my long-form musings. I aim to write at least twice a year, but over
the past two years I have clearly failed in this aspect. I'll try to write more
often.

Comments can be sent to my [public mailing
list](https://lists.sr.ht/~hedy/posts) where I'll also send new posts (after
2023) as plain text. If you subscribe to the list, it acts like a newsletter
where you'll receive new posts from your inbox, and you can reply to the email
to start a public discussion.

Subscribing and adding comments happen solely through emails. No external auth
required.
