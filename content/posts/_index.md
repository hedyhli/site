Comments can be sent to my
[public mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~hedy/posts) where I'll also send new
posts as plain text. If you subscribe to the list, it acts like a newsletter
where you'll receive new posts at your inbox, and you can reply to the email
to start a public discussion.

Subscribing and commenting can happen solely through emails. No external auth
required.
