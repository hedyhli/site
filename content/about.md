Greetings, traveller.

I'm known online as ~hedy (pronouns she/her). I write and talk about software
both professionally and as a hobby. Here, I share my thoughts on topics within
software development and beyond. I'm a FOSS and accessibility advocate, and I
appreciate decentralized social media and the [personal
web](https://indieweb.org/).

You can find me on [Mastodon](https://tilde.zone/@hedy) where I ramble about
life and topics that interests me. Humans as a collective are more similar than
we think and tend to admit. If something interests me, chances are you might
find it interesting too. I also frequent in communities, such as
[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), an invite-only link aggregator similar in some
ways to Hacker News, [The 32Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/), and the
[Tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org).

In my spare time, I read and write both words and code and hack on my editor
and other parts of my [setup](#uses).
