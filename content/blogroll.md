Some of the personal websites and blogs I enjoy across the web. Emphasis on
"some".

The Gemini version of this page (linked in the footer) showcases gemlogs and
phlogs I enjoy.

Descriptions are written by myself based on my own experience gathered from
before I have decided to include someone in this list. I am not affiliated with
any of the services, companies, or products mentioned unless noted otherwise.

Entries are sorted in reverse-alphabetical order.

I always love to discover more blogs and personal sites. If you'd like to
nominate one (preferably, that isn't your own), please do not hesitate to
[contact](/about/) me.

If you'd like to correct any mistakes or would like to be removed, feel free to
update this page yourself on the [GitHub](https://github.com/hedyhli/site) or
[SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~hedy/site) repositories, or [contact](/about/)
me.
