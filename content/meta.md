<div class="callout note">

This is a `/meta` page, consider [adding your
own](/posts/meta-pages/) and document changes to your site too :)

</div>

My website is currently statically generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and
hosted with Codeberg Pages. My gemini capsule, which is generated from the same
source is hosted by Sourcehut Pages and is available at
[gmi.hedy.dev](gemini://gmi.hedy.dev/) ([What is
gemini?](https://geminiprotocol.net)). The source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/hedyhli/site).

It currently supports just a few [microformats](https://microformats.org/), and
I plan on adding more, including [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) features.
This site supports [webmentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention). For
posts, they show up at the end of each page after approval.

## Posting

Most of my posts are mirrored on Gemini. Some are converted from markdown by
hand, others using a conversion tool and editorized manually. I plan to write a
custom script that can convert markdown to gemtext without manual intervention
as part of a new custom SSG I'm working on. I manually submit new gemlog posts
on Antenna, and sometimes announce it on my [fediverse
account](https://tilde.zone/@hedy), especially if I'm currently participating in
[#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) or other writing challenges.

I write my drafts in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with a live-preview
markdown editor and the iA Writer Duo font. The Obsidian vault I use serves both
as a drafting environment and as a digital journal. Some posts might end up here
on my website, in which case, I would create a new post with a shell script,
paste the markdown, locally build, and finally publish in a single command. My
publishing process is simply git-pushing to my Codeberg Pages repo.

### Fonts

Some posts that are better suited to be considered public journal entries,
rather than articles are displayed in [iA
Writer](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) Duo font. All content uses
[Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter), meta information and headings use [IBM
Plex](https://github.com/IBM/type) Sans, and code uses IBM Plex Mono.

## Webrings

- Webrings this site is part of on the web is listed [at `/`](/)
- Orbits [my gemini capsule](gemini://gmi.hedy.dev/) is part of is also listed
  on its homepage.
